The data preparation step involves taking data provided by `r params$state.org.abv`
and producing a `.Rdata` file that will subsequently be analyzed in Step 2. This
process is carried out annually as new data becomes available from the `r params$state.type`
assessment program. `r if (!is.null(params$data.prep.text)) params$data.prep.text`
