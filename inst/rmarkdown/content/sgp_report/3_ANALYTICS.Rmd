# Analytics

This section provides basic details about the calculation of student growth
percentiles from assessment data using the [`R` Software Environment](http://www.r-project.org/) [@Rsoftware]
in conjunction with the [`SGP` package](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGP) [@sgp2020].

Broadly, the SGP analysis of the longitudinal student assessment data takes place in two steps:

1. Data Preparation
2. Data Analysis

The majority of the effort in the above two step process lies with Step 1: Data
Preparation.  Following thorough data cleaning and preparation, data analysis using
the `SGP` package takes clean data and makes it as easy as possible to calculate,
summarize, output and visualize the results from SGP analyses.
