##  Data Analysis

The objective of the student growth percentile (SGP) analysis is to describe how
(a)typical a student's growth is by examining his/her current achievement relative
to students with a similar achievement history; i.e his/her *academic peers*.^[see
[this presentation](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGP_Resources/blob/master/presentations/Academic_Peer_Slides.pdf)
for a description of academic peers.] This norm-referenced growth quantity is
estimated using quantile regression [@Koenker:2005] to model curvilinear functional
relationships between student's prior and current scores.  One hundred such
regression models are calculated for each separate analysis (defined as a unique
***year** by **content area** by **grade** by **prior order*** combination`r if(!is.na(params$eoct.tf)) {
  ", with student grade-level ignored in EOC subjects"} `).  The end product of
these 100 separate regression models is a single coefficient matrix, which serves
as a look-up table to relate prior student achievement to current achievement for
each percentile. This process ultimately leads to tens of thousands of model
calculations `r if() {"(and many more when SIMEX measurement error corrections
  are performed)"}` during each of `r params$state`'s annual round of analyses.
For a more in-depth discussion of SGP calculation, see Betebenner
[-@Betebenner:2009]`r if (!is.null(params$appendix) & agrepl("SGP Methodology", params$appendix.title, ignore.case=TRUE)) {
  paste(" and", params$appendix[agrep("SGP Methodology", params$appendix.title,
  ignore.case=TRUE)], "of this report")}``r if(grepl("SIMEX", params$sgp.type)) {
  ", and see Shang, VanIwaarden and Betebenner [-@ShangVanIBet:2015] for further
  information on the SIMEX measurement error correction methodology"}`.


SGP analyses follow a work flow established in previous years that includes the
following 3 steps:

1. Update the `r params$state` `r params$state.type` assessment meta-data required
for SGP calculations using the `SGP` package.
2. Create annual SGP configurations for analyses.
3. Conduct all`r ifelse(params$eoct.tf, " EOG and EOC ", " ")`SGP analyses.
4. Combine results into the master longitudinal data set, summarize results and
output data.
