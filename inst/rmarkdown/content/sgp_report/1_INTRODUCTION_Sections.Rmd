This report includes four sections:

- ***Data - *** includes details on the decision rules used in the raw data
preparation and student record validation.
- ***Analytics - *** introduces some of the basic statistical methods and the
computational process implemented in the `r params$year` analyses.^[More in-depth
treatment of the SGP Methodology can be found [here](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGP_Resources/tree/master/articles)

  paste(" and in", params$appendix[agrep("SGP Methodology", params$appendix.title, ignore.case=TRUE)], "of this report")}`].
- ***Goodness of Fit - *** investigates how well the statistical models used to
produce SGPs fit `r params$state.name` students' data.  This includes discussion
of goodness of fit plots and the student-level correlations between SGP and
prior achievement.
- ***SGP Results - *** provides basic descriptive statistics from the `r params$year`
analyses at both the `r params$state.type` and school levels.
