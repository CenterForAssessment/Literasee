#  Introduction

This report contains details on the `r params$year.long` implementation of the
student growth percentile (SGP) model for `r if (!is.null(params$non.state)) {
  paste0("the ", params$non.state.org, "(", params$non.state.org.abv, ")")} else {
  paste("the state of", params$state.name)}`. `r if (!is.null(params$params$analytics.org.name)) {
  paste0("The", params$analytics.org.name, "(", params$analytics.org.abv, ")
contracted with the ", params$state.org, "(", params$state.org.abv, ") to implement
the SGP methodology")} else {"The SGP methodology was implemented"}` using data
derived from the [`r params$test.name[1]` (`r params$test.abv[1]`)](`r noquote(params$test.url[1])`)
`r if(length(params$test.name) > 1) paste0("and [", params$test.name[2], " (",
params$test.abv[2], ")](", params$test.url[2], ")")` to create the `r if (!is.null(params$sgp.model.name)) {
  paste0("[", params$sgp.model.name, "(" params$sgp.model.abv, ")](", noquote(params$sgp.model.url), ")")} else {
  paste(params$state.name, "Student Growth Model")}`.  `r if (!is.null(params$params$analytics.org.name)) {
  paste("The goal of the engagement with", params$state.org.abv`, "is to create
  a set of open source analytics techniques and conduct analyses that will
  eventually be conducted exclusively by", params$state.org.abv`, "in following years.")}

The SGP methodology is an open source norm- and criterion-referenced student
growth analysis that produces student growth percentiles `r if (!is.null(params$sgp.projections)) {
  "and student growth projections/targets "}`for each student in the `r params$state.type`
  with adequate longitudinal data.  The methodology is currently used for many
  purposes.  States and districts have used the results in various ways
  including parent/student diagnostic reporting, institutional improvement, and
  school and educator accountability.  Specifics about the manner in which
  growth is included in school and educator accountability can be found in
  documents related to those accountability systems.
