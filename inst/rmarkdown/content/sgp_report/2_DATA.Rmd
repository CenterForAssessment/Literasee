#  Data

`r params$state.org.abv` supplied `r params$test.abv[1]``r if(length(params$test.name) > 1) {
	paste(" and", params$test.abv[2])}``r if (params$eoct.tf) {" end-of-grade (EOG) and end-of-course (EOC) test"}`
data used in the `r params$year` SGP analyses`r if (!is.null(params$params$analytics.org.name)) {
	paste(" to the", params$state.org.abv, "in summer of", params$year)}`. These
test records were added to existing `r params$state` assessment data to create
the longitudinal data set from which the `r params$year` SGPs were calculated.
Subsequent years' analyses will augment this multi-year data set allowing
`r params$state.org.abv` to maintain comprehensive longitudinal data for all students
taking the`r if (params$eoct.tf) {" EOG and EOC"}``r params$test.abv[1]``r if (length(params$test.name) > 1) {
	paste(" and", params$test.abv[2])}` assessments.

Student Growth Percentiles have been produced for students that have a current
score and at least one prior score in either the same subject`r if (params$eoct.tf) {
	" or a related content area"}`.  For the `r params$year` academic year SGPs
were produced for grade level `r params$GL_text_long``r if (params$eoct.tf) {
	paste(", as well as for EOC subjects including", params$EOCT_text_long)}`.
