    }

```


* Package Released.

We're pleased to announce the first release of the Literasee package. The package isn't available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Literasee)
yet so you'll need to install it off of GitHub.

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("centerforassessment/Literasee")
```

Thereâ€™s not much in the package yet: Just a single function `reportSGP`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(Literasee)
reportSGP()
```

You can see the documentation for more info on the `reportSGP` arguments.

Literasee is under active development. We :heart: feedback and are happy to answer questions.
