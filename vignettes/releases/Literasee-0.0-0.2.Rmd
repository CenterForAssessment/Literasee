```


We're pleased to announce the first release of the Literasee package. The package isn't availabe on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Literasee) 
yet so you'll need to install it off of GitHub. 

```
devtools::install_github("centerforassessment/Literasee")
```

Thereâ€™s not much in the package yet: Just a single function `reportSGP`.

```r
library(Literasee)
reportSGP()
```

You can see the documentation for more info on the `reportSGP` arguments.

Literasee is under active development. We :heart: feedback and are happy to answer questions.
