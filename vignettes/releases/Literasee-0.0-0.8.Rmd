```{r include = FALSE}
    library(SGP)

    is_html_output = function() {
        knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to")=="html"
    }

    knitr::opts_chunk$set(
        collapse=TRUE,
        comment="",
        prompt=TRUE,

* Add VERY preliminary .Rmd bones for skeleton technical report construction.
* Fix documentation so that pkgdown documentation generation works correctly.

The package isn't available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Literasee)
yet so you'll need to install it off of GitHub.

```
devtools::install_github("centerforassessment/Literasee")
```

Literasee is under active development. We :heart: feedback and are happy to answer questions.
