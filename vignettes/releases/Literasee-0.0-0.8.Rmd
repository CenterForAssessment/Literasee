# Changes in version: Literasee 0.0-0.8

  * Add VERY preliminary .Rmd bones for skeleton technical report construction.
  * Fix documentation so that pkgdown documentation generation works correctly.

The package isn't available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Literasee) 
yet so you'll need to install it off of GitHub. 

```
devtools::install_github("centerforassessment/Literasee")
```

The main function, `reportSGP`, can be tested with the following code:

```r
library(Literasee)
library(SGP)

###  Run testSGP(3) in order to get a test SGP object

testSGP(3)


###  Load Data (Demonstration_SGP from testSGP(1) or testSGP(3) ) and package
load("Data/Demonstration_SGP.Rdata") # Use to test EOCT Documentation
require(Literasee)


###  Create .Rmd "skeleton" report from boilerplate content
reportSGP(Demonstration_SGP, output_file="docs/SGP_Report.Rmd", sgp.year = tail(unique(Demonstration_SGP@Data$YEAR), 1))

###  Render .Rmd file into PDF and HTML formatted reports.
setwd("docs")
renderMultiDocument(rmd_input = "SGP_Report.Rmd", report_format = c("HTML", "PDF"))

reportSGP()
```


Literasee is under active development. We :heart: feedback and are happy to answer questions.
